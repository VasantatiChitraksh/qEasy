*Queue-based Patient Waiting Time Predictor for Aravind Eye Hospital*  

---

## 🚀 **About**  
**QEasy** is a smart Flutter application integrated with Firebase to predict patient waiting times for **pre-examination routines**. Designed as part of a **hackathon** at Aravind Eye Hospital, this app enhances operational efficiency by leveraging **Queue Data Structure** algorithms.  

---

## 🧠 **How It Works**  
1. **Dynamic Queue System**: Utilizes the **queue DSA** to manage patients' turn flow.  
2. **Predictive Algorithm**: Waiting time is calculated based on:  
   - **Position in the Queue**  
   - **Average Pre-Examination Time**  
     \[ `Waiting Time = (Queue Position × Avg Pre-Examination Time)` \]  
3. **Real-Time Integration**: Firebase ensures seamless **data updates** for accuracy.
